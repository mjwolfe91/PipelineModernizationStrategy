Scenario: Our partners rely on near real-time dashboards summarizing app traffic and user engagement. Currently, these data pipelines are fragmented across numerous disparate tools and cloud environments, causing high cognitive load, increased fragility, and difficulty in ensuring data consistency. We need a strategic approach to modernize and consolidate these pipelines, significantly reducing complexity, enhancing reliability, and ensuring a high-fidelity data experience. 

Task: Describe your strategic vision for addressing this challenge. Your response should outline how you would holistically investigate the current state and identify strategic opportunities; propose your future-state architecture principles and a conceptual design for the modernized pipelines; define the key functional and non-functional requirements (e.g., latency, reliability SLAs, scalability, data quality, operational efficiency) that would guide implementation and define success. As a hands-on component, provide a simplified code example of a critical data transformation or an abstract data contract (e.g., using a simplified YAML/JSON structure) for a key data product(s) within your proposed modernized pipeline. Finally, provide a high-level phased approach for migration and delivery.
